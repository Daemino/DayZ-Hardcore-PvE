This repository just archives the server settings I made and saves it for future use. Server's Discord:

Do not just copy-paste the files into another server file, but mirror the settings changed instead. Files are modified with DayZ-Expansion features, and my mod with skin variants and modified M1025. A server with such an amount of loot is designed for Hardcore PvE and none of the items in the types.xml file are multiplied but decreased up to 90%. If you do not know what certain things mean, gather more knowledge and then try to adjust it, otherwise, the server will collapse due to unnecessary typos people make all the time.
